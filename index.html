            <h3>Hello! My name is Drew, and this is a website for all of my favorite stews! </h3>

            <p class="stewparagraph"><strong>First off, welcome to my website, and thank you for taking the time to look around!</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a little project I've had on my mind for the better part of the semester, and I'm
            excited to finally show it off to the world! <i>(or at least anyone who comes across it!)</i> 
            May this website serve as an icon for my love of cooking and stews in particular. I hope you'll find a lot
            to do here! I included a <a href="stewquiz.html">stew-themed quiz</a>, <a href="contact.html">contact pages</a>, and of course <a href="index.html#enstewclopedia">a few pages on stews!</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Up near the top of every page, you'll also find a handy dandy little navigation menu, a way to bookmark
            any page, mess around with the look of the page, and a button to a random stew page if you get bored!
            </p>

            Now, the first question you may be asking at this very moment is: <strong>what is a stew?</strong>
            I'm glad you asked! A stew, at its core, is any kind of dish that uses ingredients cooked in a
            liquid base, like stock or broth, for example. Stews are cooked slowly over a long
            time with heat for everything to get to know each other in the pot.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>"But isn't that just soup?"</i> you may ask. NO! Well, maybe. Sometimes?<br>To be perfectly honest,
            the line between soup and stew can be as foggy as clam chowder. The consensus I seemed to find
            online and from <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/packages/food-network-essentials/soup-vs-stew" target="_blank">various recipe pages</a>, is that stews tend to be thicker than soups, using less liquid
            and more solid foods.

            <p>Now, there are <em>hundreds</em> of other stews out there. For the purposes of this website, I
            just included a broad swath of my favorites. That means there are a <em>ton</em> I'll have missed.

                have their own subclasses of stew like the chili and curry above. It all gets highly
                technical, flavorful, maybe even a little controversial, but that's stew for you!

                    Did you know there's a type of stew that can potentially last for years without ever going bad?
                    This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_stew" target="_blank">perpetual stew</a>. Basically, you keep adding fresh ingredients and liquid to the
                    stew while simmering, and as long as it is properly cared for, it can last for <strong>decades</strong>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was skeptical at first. After all, <em>perishable foods have to go bad after a while, right?</em> Well,
                    they do, but that's where the constant care by addition of fresh foods and a nice inferno
                    come in. I think that's salient advice that goes even beyond stew: <strong> with watchful care
                    and proper maintenance, something may last longer than you'd think.
                    </strong>
                <br>
                </p>
                <p>That's about all I had for right now! I hope you enjoyed exploring this website as much as I did
                   broiling it! I feel like I have both attained enough stew knowledge for ten lifetimes, and yet
                    this is just the top of the bowl.
